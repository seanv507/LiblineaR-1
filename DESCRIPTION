Description: A wrapper around the 'LIBLINEAR' C/C++ library for machine
    learning (available at
    <http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear>). 'LIBLINEAR' is
    a simple library for solving large-scale regularized linear
    classification and regression. It currently supports
    L2-regularized classification (such as logistic regression,
    L2-loss linear SVM and L1-loss linear SVM) as well as
    L1-regularized classification (such as L2-loss linear SVM and
    logistic regression) and L2-regularized support vector
    regression (with L1- or L2-loss). The main features of
    LiblineaR include multi-class classification (one-vs-the rest,
    and Crammer & Singer method), cross validation for model
    selection, probability estimates (logistic regression only) or
    weights for unbalanced data. The estimation of the models is
    particularly fast as compared to other libraries.
